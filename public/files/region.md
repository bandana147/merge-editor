### **Marketing and IT collaborate to launch digital experiences faster**

Adobe strives to set the standard for great digital experiences—a goal that requires constant innovation. The company’s marketing teams use [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://business.adobe.com/index.html) to experiment with web content and personalization, continually looking for the best ways to engage people. But they don’t do it alone. IT also plays an important role in creating digital experiences, writing code to launch new sites and new functionality. Time to market is crucial, so the less coding required, the better.

Lukas Ryf, Head of the Web Platforms Team at Adobe, explains: “For the Adobe MAX conference, marketing needed to launch a new home page with a slightly different design—a project that looked relatively simple on the surface. However, to fit the work into our planning and release cycle, we needed six weeks to launch. We knew marketing needed to work faster, so we started to think differently about our approach.”

The Web Platforms Team’s solution was to create a shared content management system across all the web properties at Adobe that run on [Adobe Experience Manager](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/adobe-experience-manager.html). That includes Adobe.com, Adobe Help Center, partner portals, and the company’s intranet, Inside Adobe.

“We’ve bundled up a lot of code into reusable pieces using Experience Fragments, which are accessible directly through the Adobe Experience Manager authoring interface,” says Ryf. “That means marketing teams can launch pages in days instead of weeks, improving their time to market by a factor of 10.”

The solution brings new levels of agility to the marketing and engineering teams, building on key features available in products within Adobe Experience Cloud, including Adobe Experience Manager and [Adobe Target](https://business.adobe.com/products/target/adobe-target.html), both part of [Adobe Marketing Cloud](https://business.adobe.com/products/marketing-cloud/main.html), and [Adobe Analytics](https://business.adobe.com/products/analytics/adobe-analytics.html), part of [Adobe Analytics Cloud](https://business.adobe.com/products/analytics/analytics-cloud.html).

### Breaking down siloes for greater efficiency

In the past, all changes to a website had to go through the full engineering process—everything from launching a new web page to modifying the layout to setting up an AB test. Each web property ran on its own implementation of [Adobe Experience Manager](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/adobe-experience-manager.html), supported by a dedicated engineering team.

“Separate code bases prevented our scrum teams from sharing their knowledge and work, so there was a lot of redundancy and inefficiency,” says Ryf. “With a unified platform for our Adobe Experience Manager implementations, we’re starting to dissolve engineering siloes while providing the tools marketers need to create amazing digital experiences.”

In other words, the IT team can write code once to create reusable components and make them available across web properties, from the home page to the intranet. That means marketers can build sophisticated digital experiences themselves, grabbing ready-to-use page layouts, page functionality, templates and test cases. The platform includes all the high availability services on the back end, including content localization capabilities and operational automation, to enable fast launches with no engineering work.

### Building blocks for a better digital experience

[Adobe Experience Manager](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/adobe-experience-manager.html) Experience Fragments play an important part in the solution, providing discrete bundles of code that can be slotted into a larger digital experience. For example, an Experience Fragment could be a section on a home page containing a hero image and a call to action button. Or it could provide the structure for a full-page help desk article.

“Each Experience Fragment is a piece of content that can be reused,” explains Audumber Ramesh, Senior Product Manager at Adobe. “Because the containers are channel-agnostic and available across sites, authors can use them to create a variety of experiences, no matter how their digital properties are structured and designed.”

Experience Fragments can be used across channels, so marketing teams can create more consistent and seamless digital experiences. For example, marketers can use an Experience Fragment to create a landing page on Adobe.com with personalized image, copy, and call to action—and then quickly replicate the content for an omnichannel experience, optimizing it for a mobile app or browser, social media, and an email campaign.

The solution also takes advantage of Touch UI, the new Adobe Experience Manager interface that can make developers and authors more productive with a responsive, mobile-first design and reusable components.

“Touch UI is the future of Adobe Experience Manager, so we’re making the transition easy and appealing for our customers,” says Ramesh.

### New levels of optimization and personalization

The team has integrated Experience Fragments with [Adobe Target](https://business.adobe.com/products/target/adobe-target.html), which makes it easy to run AB tests on different elements of the digital experience—without help from engineering. Through the integration of [Experience Manager](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/adobe-experience-manager.html) and Target, optimization teams were able to segment and redirect traffic from one home page to another using Redirect Offers with Target making it easy to track and report on key performance indicators for traffic volumes.

“AB testing previously required custom code, which was not scalable,” says Chris Millar, Engineering Manager on the Adobe.com Platform Team. “Now, by exporting Experience Fragments into Adobe Target, marketing optimization teams can easily create and test their own experiences to achieve new levels of personalization.”

The team is tracking Experience Fragments using [Adobe Analytics](https://business.adobe.com/products/analytics/adobe-analytics.html) to gain more granular insights into how people use its websites, with a view into impressions and clicks at the fragment level. The company has already observed significant benefits thanks to optimized performance and a better user experience, made possible through improved authoring capabilities.

Conversion rates are up in several areas on Adobe.com. App download rates increased 26%, from 10.2% to 12.9%. Click-through rates on key pages have risen 15%, from 39% to an impressive 45%. Order rates have dramatically improved with a 30% increase in total orders for customers encountering a personalized experience compared to customers visiting a default page.

Website performance has improved, as well. “By consolidating our code within Adobe Experience Manager, we’ve seen page load times improve by 53%, from 3.1 seconds to 1.45 seconds,” says Millar. “Even better, we can update code in one place and see performance enhancements across all sites, not just one.”

### Customer zero for Adobe Experience Cloud

For Adobe, the use of Experience Fragments serves multiple purposes. For IT, the new approach brings greater efficiency and scalability, enabling teams to support an expanding collection of digital properties.

For marketing teams, the solution offers new levels of autonomy and agility. Instead of waiting for IT to develop new functionality or make minor design changes, marketers have the tools they need to build their own pages and incorporate increasing levels of personalization. That means faster time to market for time-sensitive campaigns and events, with new experiences launching in days rather than weeks. Plus, the solution encourages more experimentation by taking IT out of the testing and optimization process.

But the benefits aren’t limited to the internal teams at Adobe. They also extend to Adobe customers.

“Our customers sometimes don’t realize how powerful [Adobe Experience Manager](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/adobe-experience-manager.html) can be,” says Ryf. “As a customer for our own solutions, we’re always pushing the product forward to demonstrate what’s possible. We’re excited to help customers get even better at creating exceptional digital experiences.”
